Hosting Application or Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Developers can create application and services using GridAPPS-D API and use following instruction to host it with the platform.
For example of application and service working with GridAPPS-D, please see: https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/gridappsd-sample-app and 
https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/gridappsd-state-estimator

1. Create proper folder structure for the application or service.

Following is the recommended structure for applications or services working with gridappsd using sample-app as an example:

For application:
::
		
	.
	├── README.md
	└── my_app
	    ├── app
	    │   ├── [application exe or pythod code]
	    ├── requirements.txt
	    ├── my_app.config
	    └── setup.py
	    
For service:
::
		
	.
	├── README.md
	└── my_service
	    ├── service
	    │   ├── [service exe or pythod code]
	    ├── requirements.txt
	    ├── my_service.config
	    └── setup.py
	    
Where config file is used by GridAPPS-D to launch the application or service from inside the gridappsd container. 

Example config for application:

::

	{
	    "id":"sample_app",
	    "description":"GridAPPS-D Sample Application app",
	    "creator":"PNNL",
	    "inputs":[],
	    "outputs":[],
	    "options": ["(simulationId)"],
	    "type":"PYTHON",
	    "execution_path": "sample_app/runsample.py",
	    "launch_on_startup":false,
	    "prereqs":["fncs","fncsgossbridge"],
	    "multiple_instances":true
	}

Example config for service:

::

	{
		"id":"state-estimator",
		"description":"State Estimator",
		"creator":"PNNL",
		"inputs":["/topic/goss.gridappsd.fncs.output","/topic/goss.gridappsd.se.input"],
		"outputs":["/topic/goss.gridappsd.se.requests","/topic/goss.gridappsd.se.system_state"],
		"static_args":["(simulationId)"],
		"execution_path":"service/bin/state-estimator.out",
		"type":"EXE",
		"launch_on_startup":false,
	        "prereqs":[],
		"multiple_instances":true,
		"environmentVariables":[]
	}


2. Clone the repository https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/gridappsd-docker (refered to as gridappsd-docker repository) next to this repository (they should both have the same parent folder)

::
	
	.
	├── gridappsd-docker
	└── gridappsd-sample-app
	

3. Add application or service to platform

In order to add your application/service to the container you will need to modify the docker-compose.yml file included in the gridappsd-docker repository. 
Under the gridappsd service there is an example volumes leaf that is commented out. Uncomment and modify these lines to add the path for your application and config file. 
Adding these lines will mount the application/service on the container's filesystem when the container is started.

For application:

::
	
	#    volumes:
	#      - ~/git/gridappsd-sample-app/sample_app:/gridappsd/applications/sample_app
	#      - ~/git/gridappsd-sample-app/sample_app/sample_app.config:/gridappsd/applications/sample_app.config
	
	    volumes:
	      - ~/git/[my_app_directory]/[my_app]:/gridappsd/applications/[my_app]
	      - ~/git/[my_app_directory]/[my_app]/[my_app.config]:/gridappsd/applications/[my_app.config]

For service:

::
	
	#    volumes:
	#      - ~/git/gridappsd-sample-app/sample_app:/gridappsd/applications/sample_app
	#      - ~/git/gridappsd-sample-app/sample_app/sample_app.config:/gridappsd/applications/sample_app.config
	
	    volumes:
	      - ~/git/[my_service_directory]/[my_service]:/gridappsd/services/[my_service]
	      - ~/git/[my_service_directory]/[my_service]/[my_service.config]:/gridappsd/services/[my_service.config]	 
		  
How to start a service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Note: This process will be simplified in future releases so user could start a service through API and UI for a simulation with or without an application.*

Currently a service will be started by the platform only if it is a requirement for an application as described in the application config file under prereqs key.
By default gridappsd-sensor-service and gridappsd-voltage-violation  services are available in GridAPPS-D docker container. 

In order to start a service with an application (sample app in this example) follow these steps:

1. Go into sample app container by executing
::
	
	docker exec -it gridappsddocker_sample_app_1 bash

2. Inside sample app container execute following commands 
::
	
	apt-get update

	apt-get install vim

4. Edit sample_app.config and add service id to the prereqs as shown below:
::
	
	"prereqs":["gridappsd-sensor-simulator"]

*Note: Service id should match the value of "id" in service config file.* 

5. Exit sample app container

6. Restart sample app docker container by executing
::
	
	docker restart gridappsddocker_sample_app_1

7. Go into GridAPPS-D docker container by executing
::
	
	docker exec -it gridappsddocker_gridappsd_1 bash

8. Start platform by executing
:

	./run-gridappsd.sh
	
Now when you start a simulation with sample app the service defined in prereqs will start as well.
