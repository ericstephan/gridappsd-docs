	- Sensor service in available in gridappsd container by default. Sensor service is no longer required to be added in gridappsd container via docker-compose file.
	- Default log level is changed from DEBUG to ERROR for limiting the amount of log messages on terminal. 
	- **Breaking API change** - Simulation input and output topics changed in gridappsd-python from FNCS_INPUT_TOPIC to SIMULATION_INPUT_TOPIC and FNCS_OUTPUT_TOPIC to SIMULATION_OUTPUT_TOPIC.
	- **Breaking API change** - Simulation request return a json with simulation id and list of events with their uuids instead of just simulation id.

Version 2019.09.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. New Features
		
	- Fault Processing: Faults are working on radial feeders. 
	- Note: Faults are not working on meshed systems. If you have a meshed system then send switch open message to simulate the fault.

Version 2019.10.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. New Features
		
	- Alarms service created. It publishes alarm whenver a switch or capacitor is opened or closed. It is added as a pre-requisite for sample app.
	- Load profile data pre-loaded in timeseries data store InfluxDB. 
	- Load profile file ieeezipload.player is created dynamically based on simulation start time and duration.
	- API updated in platform and Proven to query load profile data.
	- Timeseries API updated to accept timestamps in seconds instead of micro or nanosecond.
	- Timeseries API updated to accept query filters in an array instead of single value. 
	- Viz app: User can search and highlight objects on network by name and mrid.
	- Viz app: User can re-center network graph.
	- Viz app: Displays alarms in a saperate tab when simulation is running. Notifies when a new alarm is received in alarm tab. 
	- Viz app: User can upload scheduled commands json file with communication outage and faults.
	- Viz app: Switches are displayed as closed/opened based on simulation output value.
	- Viz app: Display image for switches are changes to green/red squares and moved between nodes.
	- Bug fixes in DSS configuration.
	- GridLAB-D updated to latest develop version.
	- OpenDSSCmd updated to 1.2.3.
	- Powergrid models - Updated Generator.dss to include kVA for generators. 
	- Added kva base to glm file, so setting kw=0 does not make the kva base also 0.
	- Internal house loads added. Schedule file is created for simulation when useHouses=true. 
	- Sensor service bugs fixed.
	- API added to export Vnom opendss file.
