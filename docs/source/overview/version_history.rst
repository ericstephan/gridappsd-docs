	- Sensor service in available in gridappsd container by default. Sensor service is no longer required to be added in gridappsd container via docker-compose file.
	- Default log level is changed from DEBUG to ERROR for limiting the amount of log messages on terminal. 
	- **Breaking API change** - Simulation input and output topics changed in gridappsd-python from FNCS_INPUT_TOPIC to SIMULATION_INPUT_TOPIC and FNCS_OUTPUT_TOPIC to SIMULATION_OUTPUT_TOPIC.
	- **Breaking API change** - Simulation request return a json with simulation id and list of events with their uuids instead of just simulation id.
